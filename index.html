        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi !! I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Cybersecurity at the University
          of West London and working as a Cybersecurity Researcher with Encrypt
          Bytes. I’m passionate about building secure web applications,
          exploring penetration testing, and creating automated security
          tools—all while juggling my favorite coding languages like Python,
          JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Django, and more across Linux and Windows. I
          really enjoy breaking down complex tech stuff into simple, clear ideas
          and working with people from different backgrounds. But cybersecurity
          isn’t my only canvas! As a passionate artist, I find inspiration in
          drawing and painting, bringing the same creativity and attention to
          detail to both my art and my code. Currently, I’m also deepening my
          curiosity in machine learning, eager to see how this technology can
          make security smarter and more adaptive. Whether I’m sketching a
          landscape or solving a real-world security problem, I approach every
          challenge with creativity, curiosity, and a love for continuous
          learning—always aiming to bridge the gap between art and technology in
          my journey
